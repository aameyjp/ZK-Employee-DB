# ZK-Employee-DB
Built an employee database system using Java &amp; ZK framework. The main page is in MVVM pattern while login page is in MVC pattern. The application performs CRUD operation along with other features like sorting, searching &amp; also have user validations. In, this project I have used different types of inputs like intbox, textbox, datebox, listbox, etc. present in the ZK framework.
